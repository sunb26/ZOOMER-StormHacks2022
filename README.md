# Inspiration
Gen Z - the next generation of brilliant minds and prodigies. With technology growing at such a rapid pace in our present time, it is hard for companies and Zoomers alike to find common ground in what Zoomers look for in their goods and services.

Reddit is trusted by the majority of Gen Z investors: 61% find Reddit a trustworthy source of information on investing Social media is a main source of investing advice: 91% of Gen Z respondents used social media for information on investing, more than any other source of information Youtube is the dominant social media source: 71% of Gen Z investors used YouTube to get investing information in the past month

Of course any generation needs to learn the importance of banking and investing and that is why our app Zoomer bridges the gap between current popular Gen Z technology and investment banking.

# Challenges we ran into
Lots of incompatibilities when trying to perform parallel executions. Ran into issues coordinating virtual environments with Bash Scripts and creating polling feature for stock price notifications. Furthermore, there were problems when training the NLP model purely due to lack of sample size.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
Being to implement scalable technology and complex coupling between software components. Having access to so many APIs and frameworks allowed us to really get creative and have a bit of fun with everything. We are super proud of the finished product and how the prototype is fully functional!

# What we learned
Multithread processing is terrible in python
Natural Language Processing requires a significant amount of training data
Twilio is cool
Can use Ngrok to host online
What's next for ZOOMER
More banking features - budgeting, account balances, statements, etc.
Bank-specific investment options
Google Cloud database for more data collection (we know you banks love that stuff)
Speech-to-text for further accessibility
